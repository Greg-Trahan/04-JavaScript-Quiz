# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a timed quiz on core JavaScript concepts.

## Usage
This webpage can be used to practice knowledge on basic JavaScript concepts, and to prepare for similar quizes that may come up in future job interviews.

## What I did
I created a timed quiz that would give the user 60 seconds to answer 5 JavaScript questions. If the user gets a question wrong, they lose 10 seconds. At the end of the time, or when they answer all of the questions, they will be prompted to enter their initials, and their score will be presented on a High Scores page. They will then have the option to either go back and take the quiz again, or reset the high scores. Until the high scores are reset, they will remain in the browers local storage.

## What I learned
In this project I practiced JavaScript skills such as to to implement a timer, how to use the createElement and setAttribute functions, and how to set event listeners.
